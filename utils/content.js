		title: 'Do lessons have to be hosted in my home?',
		content: `Not at all. This is an option that is convenient for most people, but some may not have the necessary accommodations for it (e.g. piano, keyboard, space for a lesson). In that case, I have arrangements with Trinity Episcopal Cathedral to use their space. Or, my home is open for lessons in SW Portland, whichever is more convenient.`
	},
	{
		title: 'Are digital lessons an option?',
		content: `Digital lessons are offered if it is more convenient for your schedule or you are more comfortable learning digitally. This is not my default offering because many students tend to struggle with focus through digital lessons.`

	{

		content: `Children approximately 4-years-old and up are welcome, but parents will better understand their child's ability to focus on lessons and homework.`
